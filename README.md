For this test you will be required to complete a web application that will list various superheroes on screen. This app uses a C# back-end API and an Angular application front-end. It is all part of the same Visual Studio solution, and can be run locally through IIS Express by clicking the big green play button. If you don't have Visual Studio installed, you can get the free Community Edition here: https://visualstudio.microsoft.com/vs/community/

The application is already configured to display Marvel heroes, and your job is to complete the application to display the DC heroes. The repository layers are in place, and the heroes configured, and you shouldn't edit them -- although familiarise yourself with them as you will be quizzed on their structure. Examine the Marvel heroes code and use it as a guide for plugging in code to handle the DC heroes. If successful, you should be able to run your app locally, click the DC link in the navigation menu, and see a list of DC superheroes on the screen.

If you are having trouble with the Angular app, leave it for now and concentrate on the backend. You can still run the app locally and then check the output of your new code via a browser.
